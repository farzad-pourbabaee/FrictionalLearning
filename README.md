### The notebook includes the codes for the interactive plots in the paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01813](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01813)

### In the search and dynamic matching model of this paper, I find the Kolmogorov forward equation associated with the posterior belief of the decision maker. Then, I solve for its steady-state in Appendix A.8 of the paper. 

### The solution requires finding the fixed-point in the coupled system of steady-state measures and the equilibirum mapping. Also I find the optimal outcome by maximizing the social surplus. I mainly use the optimize module from the Scipy package. The interactive graphs in the code compare the equilibirum outcome with the social optimum.
